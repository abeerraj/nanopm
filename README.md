# NanoPM, single header only PatchMatch
**NanoPM** is a single header-only implementation of PatchMatch algorithm written in C++. Could be used for variety of applications.

| |PatchMatch (350 ms.)|BruteForce as Ground Truth (18 min.)|
|---|---|---|
|NNF (Nearest Neighbor Field) |![](https://raw.github.com/wiki/unclearness/nanopm/images/art_nnf_20191120.gif)|![](data/scenes2005/Art/nnf_bruteforce.jpg)|
|Distance|![](https://raw.github.com/wiki/unclearness/nanopm/images/art_dist_20191120.gif)|![](data/scenes2005/Art/distance_bruteforce.jpg)|

## Example applications

- dense optical flow

- image synthesis (WIP)
- inpainting (WIP)

# Optional Dependencies
You can include optional dependencies in nanopm.h (mainly for I/O) but it will no longer be "single header-only".
- stb (default ON)
    https://github.com/nothings/stb
    - Image I/O
- OpenCV (default OFF)
    - cv::Mat_ as Image class. Image I/O
- OpenMP (default OFF)
    (if supported by your compiler)
    - Multi-thread accelaration
